# Environment Configuration Example
# Copy this file to .env and update the values

# Environment name (development, staging, production)
ENV=development

# Set to 'true' to use test collections in Firestore
# This keeps test data separate from production data
USE_TEST_COLLECTIONS=true

# How to use different environments:
# 1. For development: Copy .env.development to .env
# 2. For production: Copy .env.production to .env
# 3. Or manually set USE_TEST_COLLECTIONS in .env

# Available collections:
# Production: Jobs, Customers, Expenses
# Test: TestJobs, TestCustomers, TestExpenses
